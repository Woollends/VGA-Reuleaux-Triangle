# VGA-Reuleaux-Triangle
The module successfully draws a Reuleaux triangle, a shape formed by blending an equilateral triangle with curved edges. The triangle is generated precisely, with minimal errors, and meets all performance constraints, displaying a green triangle on the screen as a demonstration when the system resets.
